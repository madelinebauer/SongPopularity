# Song Popularity 
Spotify Dataset

Music plays a big part in many peoples lives, including mine. For this analysis, I wanted to explore data from my favorite music platform, Spotify, to understand what features of a song leads it to being more popular. Features of songs include items such as tempo, energy level, mood, loudness and more. 

Most people simply enjoy the music they are listening to without thinking in depth about the features mentioned above, which is why I wanted to explore this data to see if any of these features play an important role in determining the overall popularity of a song. This information can be useful for song producers, artists, music marketers and other professionals within the music industry.
